- Other minor issues like volume controls and brightness controls

## PR and Forking:

- Open a PR or Fork if you like to improve this project.
- After you add features, please remove all verbose and debugging logs so that a clean EFI remains. Use release versions of both OpenCore and Kexts and remove the -v flag from boot-args in config.plist.
- Also please use GENSMBIOS from corpnewt on github, to generate your own SMBIOS for iMac19,1 or whichever SMBIOS that supports MacOS Sonoma. As I already have the one in the current plist working on my pc so it won't work.
